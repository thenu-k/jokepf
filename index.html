                <p>
                    In order to further myself in the field of web development, I took it upon myself to hone my art skills. After years of training
                    I am now an accomplished BESPOKE digital artist.

                    In this world there are a few people who excel in everything they set their mind to - these people are called GENIUSES. These people are me, and I am these people.
